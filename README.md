# Python-code
Python projects
This project is an exploratory analysis of 1074 Unicorn companies  across global markets 
To begin the analysis, I performed a data clean up 
After which I began descriptive statistical analysis, univariate and bivariate analysis 
Problems encountered include jupyter loading issues, which requred re-installation on my PC 
At various stages I encountered coding errors, difficulties in transforming values e.g text to numerical and vice versa
In most cases I was able to trouble shoot erros by comparing codes using AI, however this was not always successful and meant that I was not able to perform some analysis such as calculating average funding, highest funding and ROI
